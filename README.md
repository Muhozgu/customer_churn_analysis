## **7. Dataset**

* [Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## **8. How to Run**

1. Clone the repo
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run Jupyter notebooks or scripts for EDA & modeling
4. Open the Power BI dashboard file for visualization


## **9. Results / Insights**

* Churn rate = 27%
* Customers on month-to-month contracts are most likely to churn
* High monthly charges correlate with higher churn probability
* Random Forest achieved the best prediction accuracy (~82%)


## **10. Future Improvements**

* Deploy model as a web app (Streamlit / Flask)
* Automate Power BI dashboards with real-time data
* Try additional ML models (XGBoost, Neural Networks)
* Include more features like customer support interactions or demographic data
